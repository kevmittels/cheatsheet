    <h2>Display</h2>
    <p>Inline elements display in the direction words are displayed in a sentence.</p>
    <p>Block elements display one after the other, as paragraphs do.</p>
    <p>A block on a webpage is an HTML element that appears on a new line, i.e. underneath the preceding element in a horizontal writing mode, and above the following element</p>
    <p>For example, &lt;p&gt; is by default a block-level element, whereas &lt;a&gt; is an inline element.</p>
    <p>Using the display property you can change whether an element displays inline or as a block (among many other options); blocks are also subject to the effects of positioning schemes and use of the position property.</p>

    <h2>Position</h2>
    <p>In CSS, a box may be laid out according to three positioning schemes â€” normal flow, floats, or absolute positioning.</p>
  
    <p>Normal flow
      In CSS, the normal flow includes block-level formatting of block boxes, inline-level formatting of inline boxes, and also includes relative and sticky positioning of block-level and inline-level boxes.

      Floats
      In the float model, a box is first laid out according to the normal flow, then taken out of the flow and positioned, typically to the left or right. Content may flow along the side of a float.

      Absolute positioning
      In the absolute positioning model (which also includes fixed positioning), a box is removed from the normal flow entirely and assigned a position with respect to a containing block (which is the viewport in the case of fixed positioning).
      
      An element is called out of flow if it is floated, absolutely positioned, or is the root element. An element is called in-flow if it is not out of the flow.
